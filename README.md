## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- A C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later.
- [Optional] Git for version control.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BBM203_SoftwarePracticum.git
    cd BBM203_SoftwarePracticum
    ```

2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 -o program PA3/filename.cpp
    ./program
    ```

### Usage

Each assignment contains specific tasks related to data structures and algorithms. Please refer to the assignment-specific folders for detailed instructions on compiling and running the programs.

### Programming Assignment 4 Example Usage:

1. Compile the main file:
    ```bash
    g++ -std=c++11 -o SpaceRescue PA4/main.cpp
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./SpaceRescue sectors.dat
    ```
